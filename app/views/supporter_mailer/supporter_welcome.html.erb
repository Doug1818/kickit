<p>I’ve decided it’s time for me to cut down on <%= @program.habit.downcase %>, and I’m using a service called <%= link_to "Kick-It", "http://www.kick-it-now.com", target: "_blank" %> to help.  You'll get weekly emails showing my progress over the course of my three week program, which runs from <%= @program.start_date.strftime("%A, %B %d") %> to <%= @program.end_date.strftime("%A, %B %d") %>.</p>

<p>You don't have to do very much, but knowing that you see my results will help me stay on track.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for your support!</p>
